# Machine Learning for Metal Part Defect Prediction

This repository contains the implementation and report for the **COMP1801 Machine Learning** coursework, focused on predicting the lifespan of metal parts using machine learning techniques. The project simulates a real-world scenario where a manufacturing company seeks to estimate part longevity based on production parameters to reduce defects and improve efficiency.

## Project Overview

The main objective is to design and evaluate machine learning solutions to estimate the lifespan of metal parts and classify whether they meet specific lifespan criteria. The coursework involves:

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships.
2. **Regression Models**: Predicting the lifespan of metal parts using regression techniques.
3. **Classification Models**: Classifying parts into categories based on their predicted lifespan.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing models and selecting the best solution based on performance metrics.
5. **Report Preparation**: Summarizing results and providing recommendations to the company.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (recommended for running notebooks)


## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Visualizations and insights into dataset patterns.
- **Regression Models**:
  - Predict part lifespan using multiple regression approaches.
  - Compare models like Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
- **Classification Models**:
  - Predict whether parts meet the minimum lifespan threshold.
  - Explore binary and multi-class classification methods.
- **Evaluation**: Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Accuracy, Precision, and Recall to evaluate models.
